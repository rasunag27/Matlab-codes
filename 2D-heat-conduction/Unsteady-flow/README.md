# 2D Unsteady heat conduction

The code contains 2D heat flow for explicit and the implicit method. Both methods are given given a choice of Jacobi Iteration or Gauss Siedel iteraion to evaluate.
The end result is the same but the time matters. The user can alter the dimensions and time step to check for stability. The present code is stable.

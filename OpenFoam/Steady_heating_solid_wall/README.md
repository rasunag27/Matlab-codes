This exercise consists of simulating the steady heat conduction in a two-dimensional solid using the solver "laplacianFoam".

1. The governing equation used in Energy conservation equation.
2. The sub-folder 0 contains the "T" parameter boundary condition.
3. The blockMeshDict in the system sub-folder contains the mesh file.
4. The simulation is carried out using SteadyState.
5. To execute the simulation
	a. Run BlockMesh to create mesh.
	b. Run CheckMesh to check the mesh.
	c. Run laplacianFoam.

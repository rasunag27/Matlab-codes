This exercise contains the simulation of fluid flow along a channel with an irregular base.

1. As boundary conditions, the left side is an inlet of water at 0.5 m/s vecolity and the right side is an outlet. Initially the whole geometry contains air.

2. The problem involves two incompressible, isothermal and immiscible fluids. The solver employed is "interFoam". 

3. k-epsilon turbulence model is employed.

4. The subfolder 0 contains the Boudnary conditions for each parameters.

5. The file blockMeshDict in the sub-folder system contains the mesh details.

6. The file controlDict in the constant sub-folder contains the time parameters.

7. The simulation is run from 0 to 4.5 sec.

8. The file "channel_water_flow.ogv" contains the post-processed video.

1. The heat transfer simulation is done for an Hemisphere of 144mm diameter with internal heat source generation. The simulation is done for 1 sec. 
2. The solver used is chtmultiRegionFoam.
3. The folder 0 contains the Boundary conditions of different parameters. 
4. The folder constant contains heatSource term (fvOptions), one solid region (bottom) and one fluid region (topAir).
5. The folder system contains the mesh, time parameters, Schemes and Solutions along with topAir and bottom region.

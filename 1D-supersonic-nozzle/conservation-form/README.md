# 1D supersonic nozzle flow using MacCormack technique - Conservation form

The code contains simulation of 1D super sonic nozzle using MacCormack technique.
This code reflects the theory and results provided in "Computational Fluid Dynamics" text book written by John.D Anderson. 
The code executes velocity, mach no, pressure and mass flow graphs at the outlet.

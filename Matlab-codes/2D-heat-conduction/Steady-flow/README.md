# Steady state 2D heat conduction
The code contains the evaluation of 2D heat conduction using point iterative techniques.
The iterative techniques includes the Jacobi iteration and Gauss-Siedel Iteration method. The code also has an option to choose Successive over-relaxation technique.
The steady2dheat.m is the mail file, while others are the functions for iterative techniques.

# Linear_Convection

The Programme is done to evalute the wave equation for 1D Linear convection problem. 
The code contains a domain of length 1m with both space and time marching discretization. 
User input is given for no of grids and time step is set to 0.01. It can be changed as per the user. 
The programme outputs a plot which compares the initial and the final velocity.
